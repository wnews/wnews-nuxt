# New owners for the Colbinabbin Hotel

The Colbinabbin Hotel which sits in the hub of the town has been sold!

Mary Ann Morgan, Principal of Morgan Legal together with husband Dr. Barry Dawson have purchased the hotel. The business will be a Joint Venture with Julie Price also as Manageress.

Mary Ann and Julie both grew up in Colbinabbin and are the daughters of the late Michael (Mick) and Norm and Maureen Wright. Judy Phelan (Mary Annâ€™s Mother), still resides in the Community.

Mick and Norm were club stalwarts, Life members and local identities of the current Football Club and other organisations.

These ladies have incredibly strong networks and connections within the Colbinabbin district, Regional and Metropolitan areas and feel very passionate in ensuring the Colbinabbin community will continue to have a Pub where locals can gather, socialise, wine and dine.

Plans will be underway during the year for renovations, extension and events along with local engagements and partnerships with local business, farming, vineyards and sporting communities.

It will be a great investment for the long future and sustainability of our town and community.

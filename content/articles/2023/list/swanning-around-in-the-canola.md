# Swanning around in the Canola

 We’re used to being ‘wowed’ by the stunning gold of the canola crops in the district each year, but a more unusual sight was the bevy of swans spotted by Robyn Ryan on Kennedy’s canola on Bell’s Rd. Bevy - you ask? Of course we had to google the collective term for swans, and this is the one we chose. Other offerings were a flock, a bank, a light, a wedge, a whiteness (for black swans?), a game, a herd, a drift, a ballet, an eyrar, a lamentation, a sownder, a squadron, a team and a whiting.

# Colbinabbin Place Based Plan - community hub

The Colbinabbin Town Recreation Reserve
hosted a forum on Thursday 9 May 2024
to canvass the community’s view on the
development of a Community Hub at the
recreation reserve.

The concept of a community hub is as a
result of feedback obtained as part of both
the development of the Colbinabbin Place
Based Plan (PBP) as well as the recently
completed 2023-33 Recreation Reserve
master plan, both of which were [endorsed by
the Campaspe Shire Council in July 2023](https://www.campaspe.vic.gov.au/Our-services/Community-support-programs/Place-Based-Planning-and-Township-Facility-Planning/Colbinabbin){.text-blue-500}.

The forum focussed on the commonality
regarding the need and desire for a multi-use
community hub as the existing Rec Reserve
facilities no longer adequately cater for the
needs of current nor future users.

This situation currently restricts access
and has limitations such as no unisex,
accessible or female change facilities, lack
of family friendly design, disjointed social
rooms and inadequate catering kitchens etc.
There is a strong desire to support the future
sustainability of all current sporting clubs as
well as attract further recreational and social
opportunities.

Hence to bring the facilities up to the level
expected by not only the community but also
state sporting associations, it is proposed that
a new multi-purpose facility is constructed.

The working party composed of Dean
Wallace, Tait Hamilton, Anne McEvoy and
Tim Hill visited other pavilions, considered
site options, developed a design scope for the
hub and focussed on the vision of creating a
social hub. This aligns with the Colbo PBP
vision of ‘Our strong spirit and innovative
thinking creates a vibrant and welcoming
place for our community to thrive.’

The fifty-five attendees at the forum
provided overwhelming support for a new
community hub with the draft concept
designs displayed to provide context to the
preliminary sketches which were generously
drafted courtesy of Dale Denham of Denham
Design.

The concept hub building would be
placed on the eastern side of the oval which
would encapsulate all sporting groups in the
one venue. The designs were displayed at
the Forum to visually portray various views
and angles which provided attendees with a
great talking point and pleasingly provided
vast enthusiasm and showed community
commitment to achieve this vision.

There are numerous next steps in this
journey with the next stage requiring funding
for further development design work which
would require the Shire to tender for. The
working party are now advocating for this
step to proceed and will provide further
updates as required.

The Working party thanks Dale for his
support of the project thus far along with a
magnificent community attendance at the first
of numerous further forums.

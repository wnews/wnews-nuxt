# Easter is Rushworth’s time to shine

A sunny Easter weekend is coming up and Rushworth’s famous festival is back to a two day event!

<!--more-->

On Saturday morning, from 8.30 am, the fun begins. The market will be packed with stalls offering produce, plants and all manner of goods from throughout the region.

There will be added attractions throughout the morning to entertain all ages – a big red dragon, an animal farm, mini golf, face painting and heaps of other fun for the kids, including, of course, the ever popular Easter egg hunt at the Community House Garden at 9am.

There will be plenty of entertainment for the adults too, with live music by True Country and the majestic Colonial Clydesdales offering cart rides around Max’s Maze all day for a gold coin donation.

A highlight this year will be the return of the wood auction, now raising funds for Shearing for Kids with Cancer. This will commence at 11am at Hilder’s block.

The popular Dog Show at 10am is back again so bring along your pooch to try for a prize in one of the variety of competition categories. If creativity is your strong point you will have a chance to win a ‘best Easter bonnet’ prize at 12pm – although, be warned, it is very competitive!

To top it all off the traditional Parade will commence at 1 pm., with the wonderful Moora Horses in the lead, followed by the Wizard and an array of vintage steam machinery, trucks and cars.

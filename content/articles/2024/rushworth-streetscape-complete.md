# Rushworth streetscape works now complete

As works on Stage 2 of the Rushworth
Streetscape project reach completion,
Campaspe Shire Mayor, Cr Rob Amos
has acknowledged the patience and
perseverance of the Rushworth community
during the seven-month construction
period.

Cr Amos said the works on High Street
are basically complete, although a second
road seal is still to be applied later this year or
early next year in the warmer months.

“Of course, we will inform residents as
these works are happening and keep you
updated,” Cr Amos added.

The whole streetscape project, initially
presented to the community in 2018, spanned
almost six years after being disrupted by
some unforeseen challenges. These included
drainage issues, the discovery of underground
utilities infrastructure and some community
pushback that saw some of original the plans
revised.

Cr Amos noted the size of the project and
that breaking it up into stages minimised the
impact on the community.

“The streetscape compliments the historic
beauty of Rushworth effortlessly and will
serve the community through their monthly
markets and renowned Easter Heritage
Festival,” he said.

““I’m really thankful and proud of
the community for their understanding
throughout the works,” Cr Amos added.

## Rushworth improvements

Waranga Ward Councillor, Adrian Weston
commented on the great range of projects
happening in Rushworth and surrounding
areas.

“It’s wonderful to see the streetscape on
High Street completed. It’s just one of the
many projects happening in Rushworth right
now.

“Residents can also look forward to the
new amenities at Lions Park, which are now
also open. Just outside the amenities, the
gravel will be repaved to include disabled
parking and lighting in the works.

“The Rushworth Murchison Rail Trail
project has also started, with works expected
to be completed later this year.
“We appreciate the community’s support
and patience through the entire duration of
works in Rushworth,,” Cr Weston said.

## Feedback sought

Over the next few weeks, Council will be
seeking feedback on the communication and
project delivery of these works. Please pick
up a hardcopy survey from the Rushworth
Service Centre or have your say online.

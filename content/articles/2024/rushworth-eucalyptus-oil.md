# Rushworth Eucalyptus oil - our liquid gold!

Another family of Jones’ was living at Inglewood in the early 1900s. The progenitor of this family in Australia was William Alexander
Jones, who arrived in Inglewood as a gold miner in the late 1850s. William married Mary Anne Quinn, a lass of Irish descent, at
Inglewood in 1862.

William and Mary’s son
Thomas married Anne Eliza
Freeman in 1887, and they raised
a large family of five boys and two
girls, all born in the Inglewood
area. Thomas was a mine manager,
who unfortunately succumbed to
“miner’s disease” in 1909, at the
age of only 46. This was also a
common fate of men who worked
in the gold mines of Rushworth
and district.

For the family to survive with
the loss of the major breadwinner,
third son Arthur Freeman Jones
(Art) had to go out to work. The
family knew the other Jones
family. In fact, as a teenager, Art
was working at the Jones’ eucy
factory in Inglewood. He moved
to Rushworth to work for Phil
Jones Senior in the eucalyptus oil
production industry in Parramatta
Gully.

Eventually, he was followed
across to Rushworth by his mother
and siblings. The two girls married
into Rushworth families (Locke
and Schumann), and all members
of the family made their homes
in Rushworth and surrounding
districts.

The matriarch of the family,
Anne Eliza Jones, died in 1953
and is buried alongside her
seven children in the Rushworth
cemetery.

Over six generations, various
members of the family have been
in continuous occupation of the
site at Parramatta Gully since
1909. Acquiring the eucy business
from Phil Jones Senior in 1911,
most of the family were engaged
in the industry and/or associated
forest industries over the ensuing
years.

## Eucy at Parramatta Gully

Remember, Art Jones had come
to Rushworth from Inglewood in
1909, to work for a bloke called
Phil Jones Senior (no relation). He
rode the 130 km on his pushbike.
Art took over the business in 1911
when his widowed mother and
siblings followed him over to settle
in Parramatta Gully. The site had
been established by William Begg
in the early 1890s, well after the
gully had been worked over by the
gold miners. (There is still plenty of
evidence of alluvial mining between
the present-day site of the eucy
factory and Whroo Road, and up the
gully from the dam)

## Arthur Freeman Jones
A 1970 story in the
Shepparton News, in which Art
was interviewed, says he was “the
original member of the family
who began distilling eucalyptus
at Rushworth in 1912…and “he
is a member of the old school.”

In other words, a skilled
bushman who could turn his hand
to anything. We have mentioned
that back in the day, he cut all the
eucalyptus leaves by hand. Three
men using sickles could cut about
two tons of eucy leaves in a day.

In those days, the stumps
were left “protruding about six
inches above the surface” of the
ground, so there would be a lot
of bending and lifting to be done.
The leaves had to be loaded onto a
dray or trailer to be taken back to
Parramatta Gully for processing.

When the leaves were
processed, the oil content could
vary dramatically, depending on
a range of factors. In the Shepp
News story, Art’s son Kevin said
the best yield he had got from two
tons of leaves was 80 pounds (36
kg), but it could be as low as 6
pounds (under 3 kg). In 1970,
Kevin was receiving 63 cents
a pound for his considerable
efforts.

## Living at Parramatta Gully

When the family first set up
at Parramatta Gully, their home
was a tent, before “the boys built
their mother a tin shed.” Living
conditions were basic, with no
electricity or running water.
Water was carried from the dam
in buckets and cooking done on
an open fire.

Before the Rushworth
railway line was extended to
Colbo, just before the Great War,
buildings (including the original
Mechanics Institute) had to be
demolished or removed so that
the line could be extended across
High Street. The Jones boys
bought one of the shops, moved
it and altered it to form the basis
of the first proper home on the
site. (This house was destroyed
in a fire 80 years later, in 1994.)

Brothers Alec and Tom
joined Art in the family business,
which later included a sawmill
at Rushworth station as well as
the eucalyptus oil distilling at
Parramatta Gully. Trading as
Jones Bros, they “had contracts
with chemical companies and the
44 gallon drums of oil were taken
to the Rushworth railway station
and transported to Melbourne by
rail.” Their two other brothers
worked with them on occasions.

## Later generations

There is a direct link from Art
Jones to the current generation
of Jones’ operating in the eucy
industry at Parramatta Gully,
Rushworth. Art and his wife Doris
had three children, and their son
Kevin, and Kevin’s wife Amy,
continued the family tradition.

Kevin and Amy had 11
children, but Kevin’s life was
tragically cut short in a car accident
in 1981. Amy continued to live at
Parramatta Gully, surviving Kevin
by nearly 30 years, and now her
son Jim, still living at Parramatta
Gully, with his family takes
responsibility for continuing the
production of eucalyptus oil there,
a tradition now extending for well
over 125 years.

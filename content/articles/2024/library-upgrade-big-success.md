# Library upgrade a big success

With its modern facilities and pleasant
reading spaces the refurbished Rushworth
library promises to become a popular
community hub, attracting new registrations
and significantly increasing book loans.
Already the new facility has welcomed
53 new members and seen a 25% increase in
loans.

In addition to the upgraded surroundings,
the newly fostered interest in books has been
helped by the friendly welcome from librarian
Renee George who has been with the library
since 2021.

Renee, whose connection with the local
community has deep roots, (her great-
grandmother was born at Whroo!), grew up
in Kyabram before moving to Echuca.
She loves the small community vibe of
the local Rushworth library and is especially
excited about her new surroundings and the
events it accommodates, such as visiting
author sessions.

Renee showed off the various spaces
available for community use, including a
computer hub, a childrenâ€™s nook (perfect for
monthly story time) and a meeting room.
The welcoming atmosphere and frequent
events have certainly made the library a
vibrant space for all ages.

Guests danced and
sang to tunes from the 70’s
surrounded by an arena
of twelve stunning local
vineyards on show, food
trucks, BBQ, bars, water
cafe and Meander Designs
stalls.

Additionally, the
weather was perfect
for guest to mingle and
gather, making this an
incredibly successful
united community event.

Silo Art thanks their
many sponsors: Colbinabbin
Country Hotel, Campaspe
Shire Council, Kanangra,
Goulburn Valley Water,
Colbinabbin Football Netball
Club and Browns Stockfeed,
and to the volunteers who
assisted in setting up, working
on the day and the clean up -
all greatly appreciated.

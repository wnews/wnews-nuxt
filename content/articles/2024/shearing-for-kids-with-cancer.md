It takes a rare kind of commitment to conquer children’s cancers, and that is exactly what’s been made by My Room Children’s Cancer
Charity, with the establishment of an Australian first for childhood cancer research. And our own Rushworth ‘Shearing for Kids’ team
has contributed to the charity’s ability to make such a commitment.

Thanks to an
extraordinary funding
commitment by the charity
My Room, the Hudson
Institute of Medical Research
will be home to a new
Children’s cancer research
fellowship and laboratory.

My Room has been one
of the valuable childhood
cancer support charities that
has benefitted from the local
fund-raising efforts Shearing
for Kids with Cancer.

The five-year, $2.25
million children’s cancer
research fellowship will
fund the establishment
of a dedicated My Room
Children’s Cancer Charity
Laboratory at Hudson
Institute, with childhood
cancer specialist Assoc. Prof
Jason Cain the inaugural My
Room Children’s Cancer
Charity Fellow.

My Room’s CEO,
Margaret Zita OAM, said the
organisation was proud to be
able to create something new
in the fight against childhood
cancer.

Ms Zito acknowledged
the efforts of the Rushworth
fund-raising team, saying
“they have been incredible
supporters of My Room
Children’s Cancer Charity.”

Explaining the origin
of the 30 year old charity,
she said “Having a child
diagnosed with cancer is a
gut-wrenching experience.
It’s especially tough when
you’re stuck in a hospital
room that doesn’t feel like
home.”

Three families in this
situation decided to make a
difference by creating a more
homely setting for families
dealing with childhood
cancer.

“So, in 1993, they started
raising money to renovate the
Royal Children’s Hospitals’
cancer ward. They reached
their goal, but they knew
they couldn’t stop there.
That’s why they created My
Room.

The name was inspired
by the idea of making
hospital rooms feel just like
home – a warm, comfortable,
safe space for families in
difficult times.

“Over the past 30
years, we’ve raised over
$33 million to improve the
quality of life for children
and families affected by
childhood cancer across
Australia,” said Ms Zito.

“While our impact has
increased significantly, our
passion, commitment, and
mission to beat childhood
cancer remain unchanged.”

The charity supports a
wide range of causes, ranging
from their Samaritan Fund to
high-quality clinical care and
innovative medical research,
trials and equipment, all
with the aim to give children
the best possible chance of
beating cancer.

My Room holds a
deductible gift recipient
status (DGR1) and is also
registered with the Australian
Charities and Not-for-profits
Commission.

# Mother’s Day at The Mill

**A record number of visitors experienced the Annual Open Day at Day’s Mill and Farm South Murchison on Mother’s Day this year.
The weather was just perfect and this added to the enjoyment for all who came.**

Parks Victoria staff, who are responsible
for the property, did a sterling job in preparing
everything beforehand and offering guided tours
on the day. There was lots of signage provided
and information about the flour mill, farm out-
buildings, family home and gate-house cottage.

The compact two storey family home with
attractive wrought iron lace trim, was furnished
with items to showcase how the rooms were
used during the time the Day family lived there.
Traditional games of quoits and croquet were
set up for the visiting children.

Stalls provided handcrafts, woodwork
products, and old-world tools and period
household fittings that a blacksmith might have
fashioned back in the day.

Coffee cart and food stalls provided
welcome food and beverages. Murchison &
District Historical Society had a stall displaying
the history of agriculture in the area and in
particular, the Day’s Mill story.

Lots of descendants of the Day family
dropped by and were pleased to be able to obtain
copies of ‘In Search of our Days’, by Gillian
Day, the extensive record of many generations
of the Day family as well as other local history
books, souvenirs and information.

Day’s Mill and Farm is listed on the
Victorian Heritage Register as it is considered
the best example of an intact 19th century
milling and farm complex, with equipment
still in place such as the large mill stones for
grinding the grain to make flour.

William and Ann Day came to Australia from
England and by 1853 had secured employment
at Noorilim Station. Here they established
vegetable gardens beside the Goulburn River as
well as setting up a cartage business servicing
the many new settlers and gold prospectors
arriving in the area.

From December 1856 William was able to
purchase farm allotments at South Murchison
on the western side of the Goulburn River from
Noorilim Station and this is where the family
established the three storey Mill and family
home we see today.

Tragedy struck in 1872 when William died
as a result of a farming accident and Ann was
left a widow with seven children aged five to
nineteen years of age.

Ann capably continued to manage the Mill,
a mixed farming business and even a shop
providing household and farming supplies
operating from the house. This was in an
environment largely dominated by men and at
a time when women, let alone a woman with a
young family, did not take on the role of running
a business.

Nevertheless her business acumen is evident
in her preserved diaries, farm ledgers and
correspondence.

The property is situated in a lovely location
and presents a picturesque rural scene which
is very imposing as you walk up the driveway
towards the mill and house. It is like stepping
back in time when visiting Day’s Mill and Farm
as so much is still as it was over 150 years ago.
If you missed the Open Day this year, make sure
you come next year when it will be open to the
public again on Mother’s Day.

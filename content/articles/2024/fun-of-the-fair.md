# Fun Of The Fair

While the adults enjoyed their retail therapy at the Easter Festival, there was plenty for the children to do too. After a great turn-out for the egg hunt at the Community House, the competitions attracted lots of entries and onlookers.

Thirty dogs of all breeds and sizes were entered in the dog competition. And then the pooches were almost outdone by the number of children who appeared at midday wearing some of the most creative Easter Bonnets ever seen!

In a very popular move the traditional wood auction was revived this year by Shearing for Kids with Cancer. This was very well supported and a great success. (See report on page 4.)

The Parade was once again a huge hit with a variety of entries of vintage cars, large truck rigs and vintage steam machinery and vehicles from yesteryear, all led by the fabulous teams of draught horses and riders who came in from Moora.

President of the the Rushworth Easter Heritage Festival Committee Lyn Reade thanked everyone who came along to shop at the many stalls and local businesses and those who took part in the events of the day and stayed to enjoy the parade.

“A special thank you goes to the amazing team of volunteers who worked tirelessly over two days to make this year’s Rushworth Easter Heritage Festival the success that it was,” said Lyn.

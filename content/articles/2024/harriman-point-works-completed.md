# Harriman Point works completed

Waranga Basin’s Harriman Point has reopened following the completion of boat ramp repairs.
The recreation area was closed in early
May due to erosion occurring along the side
of the high-level boat ramp.

GMW Storage Operations Manager South
Paul Beard said the repairs went smoothly.
“We needed water levels at Waranga
Basin to drop to make the works possible,”
he said.

“It was fortuitous that the water levels
were low enough so we could complete the
works during the colder months when usage
of the ramp is lower and that we avoided
any weather delays. We appreciate people’s
patience and cooperation during these
works,” Mr Beard said.

The work was contracted to Exton
Earthworks who completed the job coming in
under budget.

Harriman Point boat ramp was upgraded
in 2022 with funding from the Victorian
Government.

The ramp was doubled in size to boost
capacity, improve safety and access and make
launching easier for boaters heading out on
the water.

Waranga Basin also has boat ramps
located at Caravan Park Reserve and Sapling
Point.

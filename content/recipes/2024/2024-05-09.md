Had to find a recipe for this edition as the
rostered columnist has COVID! Thought
you might like to try our daughter’s
Vietnamese Beef Salad.

# Vietnamese Beef Salad

## Ingredients for salad

* Vermicelli noodles
* Fried shallots
* Crushed peanuts (or cashews if prefer)
* Nice piece of beef marinated in some sweet chilli sauce or just garlic, chilli and ginger
* Any combination of:
    - Snow peas – sliced
    - Red and green capsicum thinly sliced
    - Bean shoots
    - Snow pea tendrils
    - Cucumber, halved and then sliced
    - Shredded lettuce
    - Carrot sticks
* A heap of (this is essential) coriander, mint and basil.

## The dressing

* 1 finely chopped chilli (seeds removed) or use sweet chilli sauce if you don’t like it too spicy.
* Equal amounts of fish sauce and brown sugar (eg 7tbsp fish sauce, 7tbsp sugar, which seems a lot but it is fantastic and you don’t use too much on your salad anyway)
* Small amount of hot water to dissolve sugar.

## Method

* Put vermicelli in large bowl, add boiling water and leave to sit until noodles tender. Drain and allow to cool.
* In one big bowl just combine all the salad items together and mix well.
* Cook beef searing well on each side and then remove from pan and slice thinly.
* In each serving bowl put a handful of noodles, then a handful of salad mix, a few pieces of beef, a sprinkle of fried shallots and crushed nuts and then a couple of spoonfuls of the dressing drizzled over top.

# Chicken/Sausages with potatoes, onion and rosemary.

This recipe started out with pork sausages
but I only had chicken thighs in fridge! So
that’s what I used. Feel free to go with the
‘snags’

## Ingredients

- 6 x chicken thighs
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 x cloves crushed garlic
- 1 x brown onion cut into 8 wedges
- 2 tsp rosemary leaves
- 500 gm small potatoes halved
- 250 mls dry white wine
- 250 mls chicken stock
- 150 mls cream
- 20 gm grated parmesan
- S & P
- 1 cup finely chopped silver beet

## Method

1. Preheat oven 120º C. Put chicken in a bowl toss with flour and season.
2. Heat 1 tbls oil in a large ovenproof pan, add half the chicken pieces turning occasionally until lightly browned. Remove to a plate and cook remaining chicken.
3. In the same pan using remaining oil add onion, garlic and rosemary stirring often.
4. Add potatoes, wine and stock. Return chicken to the pan and bring to the boil. Cover with lid and transfer to oven to cook for two hours.
5. Remove from oven, stir in cream and parmesan. Season, stir in silver beet, cover and cook for another 15 minutes on stove top over low heat. Scatter with remaining rosemary leaves.

Serve with rice or other vegetables.
If using sausages the recipe calls for
removing the skins and breaking meat into
3cm pieces - small meatballs!

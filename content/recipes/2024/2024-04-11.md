# Pear and Raspberry Bread

Don’t you love going to meetings where you are asked to bring a plate? You get to pick and choose whatever looks good to eat and then have the opportunity to do a bit of detective work to find out new recipes (look to see if there’s a name on the bottom of the plate, f’rinstance).

That’s how I tracked down this recipe for
a gluten-free loaf recipe. Moist, delicious and
although it was served buttered, it didn’t need
it - in my humble opinion.

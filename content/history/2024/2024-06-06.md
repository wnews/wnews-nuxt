# Farming patience tried in early June 1974

Colbinabbin range farmers were persistent,
re-sowing grain paddocks after heavy rains
had created wash-outs. The ground was still
very wet, tractors were regularly bogged and
for the farmers involved, the re-plant was an
act of hope rather than expectation. (These
days most of those paddocks are vineyards.)

A shocking accident involving the PTO of
Laurie Howell’s tractor took the lower portion
of his right leg. The Stanhope farmer lay in
his paddock for an hour, awaiting attention
from a doctor.

There was very little room in Stanhope
Hall for other dancers as debutantes waltzed
around, including Twinkle-Toes Geoff
Cruz partnering Karen Clover. In the queue
were Elwyn Bohn (Peter Lloyd), Gwenda
Maxwell (Neville Cowie), Margaret Price
(Gary Elford), Gail Job (Colin Emmett), Julie
Kent (Robert Anderson), Pamela Hancox
(John Holschier), Debra Holschier (Peter
Sherman), Carol Hancox (Geoff Goode),
Wendy McGuire (Graeme Wall), Susan Miller
(Kelvin Argus), Gail Ryan (Tony Trist),
Leanne Howard (Peter Finlay), Michelle
Lonie (Alan West), Kerryn Northausen
(David Argus), Tracee Spiby (Roly Miller)
and Julie Shaw (Tony Kilmartin). _(I note that
some of these couples later tied the knot.)_

## Police and Court news

There was news of “planning approval”
for a new police station and residence at
Rushworth. No timetable was announced so
Sergeant Geoff Durston had to endure the
dilapidation.

Stanhope dairy farmer was fined for three
offences after evidence led by the Department
of Agriculture. Officials had inspected and
laid three charges that he had failed to keep
a dairy clean, failed to keep yards clean, and
for permitting an accumulation of manure.
Farmer was fined $15 (yes, $15), with $68.16
costs for Department inspectors to attend the
hearing.

## Waranga Shire

After six years as Shire Secretary, Graeme
Calder resigned, becoming Malvern Town
Clerk.

## Community

Rushworth Fire Brigade members were
photographed after receiving awards at a
dinner attended by CFA Assistant Chief
Officer Harry Rothsay. Tom Moylan, Graham
Hawking, Eddie Gleeson, Gordon Raglus,
Aub Geisler and Alf Raglus looked very
smart but Ron Wootton, receiving his 12-year
badge, missed the memo about wearing his
brigade uniform.

Colbo Guides had a trip to Puffing Billy in
the Dandenong Ranges, as Julie Morgan was
selected for a camp in South Australia.

## Schools

Rodney Jones won High School cross-
country open event for boys, sister Denise
(now Snelling) winning the girls race. (All
Bibby and Irene’s training paid off!)
Primary School Grades 1 and 2 composite
made a scarecrow of sticks, hay and old
clothes.

Grades 2 and 3 were “finding out about
life in science. First we are going to study
plants, then we will get animal organs and
look at them”. (Apologies to those reading
over breakfast.) Submitting Grade 4 report
about a stamp club was Craig Miller.

## Personal

Jodie Perret’s brother Dean was born
to Margaret and Trevor of Rushworth, as
David and Bev Rogerson welcomed Julie to
Stanhope.

Bill Lambden, believed to be recovering
from a stroke in Kyabram hospital, died
suddenly. Details may be found in today’s
Name from the Past column.

Iris Anderson of Stanhope, wife of Bob,
also passed in Kyabram hospital.

District residents were reported
as recovering in hospital after health
emergencies. Cr. Len Coyle was in
Mooroopna hospital after a heart attack,
and Sam Cheatley of Colbo in Rochester
hospital after a stroke. Alan Jackson (snr.)
had returned to Rushworth from Melbourne
after “a 7-hour operation to transplant veins
from a leg to replace diseased arteries near
his heart”.

Wes Risstrom was reported to have
“clutch and gearbox problems” but I assume
those issues were only in his truck! Poor
Murray Hitchcock had “a major re-build on
his engine”! Again, I am guessing that this
only took his truck off the road, while Terry
Gleeson’s “diff broke on Macquarie Pass”.
While Terry was getting help, some low
individual stole $3000 worth of tarpaulins
and fittings.

Terry loaded a trailer with camping gear,
fuel and various other fluids, setting off for
a chat in his car with Pluto Perry, Jim Perry,
Stephen Brown and Ian Dunstall, and heading
for Bourke to see shearer Graeme “Ginger”
Perry in action.

Norm Smith commenced as manager of
Stanhope branch of the State Savings Bank of
Victoria. (Remember the SSB?)

## Football

Colbo’s 15-15 was too much for
Rushworth’s 10-12. All the Macs were best
for the winners: McCormack, John McEvoy
and Ken McMurtrie, together with Lundberg,
Slimmons, Ken Wilson and Graeme Reid
who kicked five goals after coming on as 19th
man. (He must have gone to the wrong end
of the ground! He was a full-back!) Farrer,
O’Sullivan, Lambden, McKeown, Roberts
and young Lloyd best for the Tigers, as Herb
Barlow booted four goals.

20th man John Brown came on for
Colbo in the final minutes, his 200th senior
appearance.

Colbo Seconds kicked a goal with five
seconds remaining, to win 7-8 to 6-8. Alf
Raglus named Colbo’s best as Bill and Trevor
Johnson, Glen Rathjen and John Brown. For
the Tigers, he found Maurice Clarke, Trevor
Hawking, Chip Hageman and Rodney Jones,
the cross-country runner.

Opting out on a very windy day at
Tooborac were John Lambden, Pluto Perry,
Bill and Herb Barlow (all claiming injury),
giving Chip Hageman his first senior game
for 1974. He saw Tooby kick ten goals in
the first quarter. Rushworth had an eight-
goal quarter after Ross Williams went off,
replaced by Twinkle-Toes Cruz. Tooborac
22-18, Rushworth 11-7. The reporter spotted
Glen Heily, John Raglus, Alec Horne, Ray
Cruz, Mick O’Sullivan and Noel Lloyd as
best players.

Stanhope were struggling in the Goulburn
Valley league, down 7-9 to Euroa’s 21-14.
Stanhope had won just one game, the Seconds
not being quite so successful.

## Netball

Netball victories were shared; Rushworth
easily in A-grade, Colbo narrowly in B-Grade,
and Rushworth very comfortably in C-grade,
Lyn-Maree Pearce and Denise Jones, the
cross-country runner, shown as best.
Against Tooborac, Rushworth B and
C-grades were successful with mentions to
Robyn Roberts, Bev Draper, Cathy Poulson
and Debbie Harrop.

In a Sunday tournament at Tatura, star
players were Gillian Risstrom, Debbie Cruz,
Denise and Wendy Jones, Lyn Merryfull and
Isabel McLean.

## Golf

Ivan Jell won B-grade on handicap with
nett 62, edging out Bruce Wootton nett 64 and
Gordon Raglus 65. A-grade was won by Mal
McLeod, with just 75 off the stick, 61 nett,
so he was playing off 14 handicap. (Way too
generous!)

The Associates event had Shirley Harrop
knock it close to the pin, putting to get her
birdie two! The day was won by Norma
Bolden.

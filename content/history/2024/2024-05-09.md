# Fire and floods in May 1974

Murchison Bakery caught fire around 4
a.m. on Saturday 4 May. Virtually all of the
premises except the oven was destroyed,
and a great setback for new owners George
and Mrs Downard, having taken over from
Caspar Boerkamp. Concerns were held for
old timber stores nearby, a grocery operated
by O’Mahoneys and a shop owned by Vin
Hare. Murchison Fire Brigade saved the day.

Flood levels of 37 feet (11.3 metres)
were recorded in the Goulburn at Murchison.
All roads into Rushworth were cut, and
Chinamen’s Bridge camping ground at
Nagambie was submerged. Mooroopna shops
were flooded and Shepparton completely
marooned.

Flooding caused road hazards, with two
deaths near Murchison East. Ken Bowman
of Stanhope ran his motor-bike into the rear
of a front-end loader driven by John Moylan
of Rushworth, and was hospitalised with a
broken arm and cuts. Many district tractors
sat bogged in paddocks.

McMillan’s old building, adjacent to
the Caledonian Hotel at Murchison, was
demolished to create a car-park for the pub. It
was the third historic building to fall in a few
months, and each had its history summarised
in the Chronicle.

## Courts

Three men faced Rushworth Court on
duck killing charges near the Little Wallenjoe
swamp, well out of season. The men told the
inspector they found the ducks in a trap, and
had wrung their necks to humanely destroy
them. Inspector plucked the ducks, and
found bullet holes! Magistrate lightened their
wallets by $15.

Band AGM was poorly attended and the
band’s future was in doubt due to lack of
players, though Bert Hawking remained the
enthusiastic bandmaster.

## Schools

Elizabeth Hart was the lady for tickets to
the Murchison Mothers’ Club smorgasboard
Dinner Dance. $9 a double, with music by
The Tonants.

Grade 6 at Rushworth drew pictures of
each other, to create a “rogues gallery”. Grade
4 student Sherry (Nurse?) took wrigglers and
pupae to school in a jar “and they rose to the
surface to breathe”.

## Personal

Mrs Hutchinson, 88, of Murchison, died
at Mooroopna after fracturing a hip in a fall.
In a section of the former Hepples’ Store
at Stanhope, Val Lupton opened her drapery
shop.

Iddles Footwear of Rochester opened
a shop in opposition to Dick O’Donnell in
Rushworth. (This was in the building now
the General Store Rushworth, operated by
Jasmin Le Deux.)

Dick advertised 390 pairs of “fashion
shoes at pre-war (1938) prices”! This most
impressive pitch in 1974 included “men’s
leather and suede shoes for $2”. All leather
shoes for women were also $2. (Check! $2.
Imagine, two shoe shops in Rushworth!)

Whitehead’s Drapery Store had a
mannequin parade, a term you don’t hear
these days. Models were Pat Cleary, Ann
Anderson, Margaret Richards, Heather
Hawking, Norma Hamilton, June Whitehead
and Miss Lynette Perry. The compere was
Mrs Nina Clyde; ticket secretary Miss Lucy
Munsey, on behalf of the CWA. One week’s
holiday for six at a beach house at Rye was
the raffle. (My mother won it, though I have
absolutely no recollection. As one of five
children, I was excluded, though I had left
home at that time!)

Advertising his carpentry and painting
business at Colbinabbin was Barry Duke.

Former Rushworth lad Malcolm Potter
kicked five goals and was named in best
players for Carlton Reserves.

## Football

Girgarre were on fire in the footy, beating
Nagambie 15-17 to 14-11, with mentions to
Ross McDonald, Colin Scripps, S. Scripps
and K. Hewitt.

Murchison fielded an Under-13 team
in a winning game against Euroa. The
enthusiastic reporter named M. Dwyer, N.
Tonizzo, G. Watson, G. Guilfoyle, J. Burls,
B. Seymour, S. Bell, P. Hicks, K. Hicks and
D. Hicks as best, being more than half the
team! Murchison Seniors were badly beaten
by Tallygaroopna.

Colbo‘s 15-16 proved too much for
Elmore’s 9.15, thanks to three goals from
Buster Hammond and Dave Pinniger. Nine
players named best were John McEvoy (father
of Ben), Albiston, Slimmons, McCubbery,
Gerry Brown, Paul Tuohey, Brian Ellis,
Pinniger and McCormack. On the bench were
Glens, McTaggart and Rathjen.

Ken Wilson was dominant in John
Brown’s Seconds team as 5-12 was better
than Elmore’s 1-5. Bryon McIntosh booted
three majors, with singles to Brown and
Gerrard Stewart.

The following week it was Colbo 19-20 to
Heathcote’s 10-14, Pinniger with five goals,
McEvoy named as best.

Rushworth’s 13-9 was no match for
Tooborac’s 21-12. Roger Barnes put six
through the tall timber but the best players
could not be read as a paragraph in the paper
was completely blurred!

Against Mount Pleasant, Rushworth
notched the first win of the season, 25-19 to
15-16. Starring was Herbie Barlow (father
of Michael) while Bob Hurley kicked four
goals, after coming on to replace Alec Horne
in the third quarter. (Alec must have been
near death, to go off injured! Former teacher
Bob is battling ill health these days, retired
at Queenscliff.) Barney Nihill was shown as
best for Mounts, as Frank Tuohey and Terry
Frawley each booted three goals.

## Netball

Rushworth’s three teams had wins over
Tooborac, with mentions to usual suspects
Pauline Wootton, Kerryn Beck, Julie Pearce,
Leayne Hawking, Karen Oliveiri, Bev
Draper, Margaret Potter and Gwen Kealy.
C-grade named five as best: Debbie Cruz,
Denise Jones, Louise Poulson, Dianne Allen
and Isabel McLean.

The following week, against Mounts,
C-grade drew their match and Vicki Durstan
was added to the best players. The Mountain
girls beat Rushworth comfortably in A-grade
and B-grade.

## Golf

Rushworth Ladies had a team in C-grade
pennant. A match at Echuca “in pouring rain
and mud” was won 3/2 over Murchison. _(Why
would both teams drive to Echuca?)_ Jean
Jessup, daughter-in-law Nan, Florence Perry,
Shirley Raglus and Alice Brown brought
home the bacon. _(It’s a figure of speech.)_

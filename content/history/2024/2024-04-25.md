# Proposal to seal road from Rushworth to Nagambie

Michael Clarke, local Member of the
Legislative Council, approached the Country
Roads Board, proposing the sealing of
the road south of Rushworth through to
Bailieston, so as to join with the Nagambie
– Heathcote Road near Chinamen’s Bridge.

Waranga Shire had sealed the first two
miles out of town and had sought external
funds to complete three more miles. (Is there
an echo of this situation today, just 50 years
later, with Maurice Clarke’s recent petition
just to make even a small stretch of the still
unsealed road safe? (I don’t think Maurice
Clarke and Michael Clarke are related.)

Neville Hepples and Mick Linford
served the last grocery customers at Hepples’
Emporium, as Neville retired, selling the
building to Ibis Milk Products.

The autumn rains had come with over
two inches (53mm) recorded in a week at
Rushworth in the middle of April, taking the
year’s total to nine and a half inches, half
the annual average. Goulburn river flooding
severely damaged cellars at the newly-opened
Michelton Winery.

A two-car collision of vehicles driven
by Peter McEvoy of Colbinabbin and
Neville Clarke of Rushworth placed Peter in
Mooroopna Hospital with a broken leg.

## Waranga Shire

Council approved four subdivisions
at Gobarup, each creating 40-acre blocks,
adding to a number of similar subdivisions
across the forest area east, south and south-
west of Rushworth. Melbourne-based
property developers were advertising blocks
for sale for people later to become known as
“tree-changers”.

Council sent a deputation to the Ministers
for Mines and Tourism, after advice from
insurance sources that the Shire would only
be insured if the Balaclava Mine was fenced.
The hunt was on to find funds for the fence.

## Hospital

With no doctor at Rushworth, Waranga
Memorial Hospital was receiving a weekly
visit from a Senior Resident doctor from
Mooroopna, and only accepting older patients
with geriatric conditions. No acute medical
cases were being admitted. (Is there an echo
of this today?)

## Schools

Rushworth Primary was into plants and
trees. Jill and Heather in Grade 6 had planted
some seeds collected from a wattle tree near
Wanalta Post Office by Mrs McMurtrie.
Grades 1 and 2 reported great height in their
beans.

Mr Ross taught Grade 4 some new
games to be played outside, called “schlag
ball, guard ball and camp-down races”. (Not
Olympic sports yet Rossy.) Mrs Mackinder
taught her class a new game called solitaire.

Children made a wreath for ANZAC Day,
and “Preps Greg and Haydn walked twenty
km in a Walkathon”. (Five-year-olds walking
twenty km? Child abuse these days!)

Murchison Primary Mothers’ Club was
headed up by Mrs Ruth Anderson, Mrs
Marion de Klijn and Mrs Liz Hart.

## Community

Colbo Young Farmers took a bus to
Geelong for State Achievement Day at
Geelong Showgrounds, Geoff Weppner
finishing a little behind the leaders in the
Welding competition, Shane Ryan a little
further behind in Tractor Driving, with “an
entertaining weekend being had by all”.
(Not sure I would have wanted to be the bus
driver.)

Rushworth Historical Society welcomed
“six car-loads of visitors”, guided to district
attractions in steady rain by Ken King,
finishing as guests of Kevin Jones at the
eucalyptus factory. A picnic lunch planned
for Whroo was held in the Shire Hall supper
room.

Rushworth Senior Citizens also
welcomed sixteen visitors from Stanhope
Senior Citizens, with singing entertainment
from Tony Crosbie, Shirley Jacobsen and
Nancy Cruz. Three competitions resulted in
wins for Mrs Johansen (dinner), Lucy Barlow
(doll) and Judy Lambden (towels). (What
were you doing there, Jude? You were not a
senior citizen in 1974!)

On CWA International Day, Miss Lucy
Munsey spoke to Rushworth CWA branch
about her recent overseas trip.

The Band’s AGM was called by President
Chief Perry and similarly long-serving
secretary Geoff Beck.

## Personal

Heather McLean of Rushworth and
Joel Reed of Oak Park announced their
engagement. Likewise Julie Walsh of
Rushworth and Gary McKendry of Highett.

Passing was Miss Jessie Hammond, who
was Heather McLean’s great-aunt.

Geoff and Lorraine Blackshaw took
over Lloyds’ Electrical and Radio shop at
Rushworth, allowing Jim Lloyd to focus on
operating the TAB, though he still did radio
and TV repairs.

## Football

Girgarre, Rushworth and Colbinabbin
Football Clubs reported practice matches,
signing of new players and clearances of
departing players. Optimism was plentiful.
Officials appointed at Rushworth
included senior timekeepers Cec Bradley and
Duncan McLean, senior goal-umpire Murray
Hitchcock, reserves goal-umpire Chief Perry,
boundary umpires Graeme Hageman and
Simon Harrop, scoreboard Noel Merryfull,
gatekeepers Tom Moylan, Bill Campbell,
Joe Kenny, Ginger Perry and Ian Borger,
and boot-studder Craig Robbins (Remember
boot-studders?)

Colbo 16-12 beat Rushworth 7-12 in
deep mud at Colbo, naming Dave Pinniger
(3 goals), Ian Reid, Gerry Brown, D.
McCormack, John Hamilton and Glen
McTaggert. Alec Horne kicked three for the
Tigers, named in the best with Herb Barlow,
Bill Barlow, Bob Hurley, Glen Heily, John
Raglus and Mick O’Sullivan.

Stanhope was still in the big Goulburn
Valley League and after an early start to
the season propped up the ladder with three
losses. The paper did not report match details.

Girgarre beat Murchison in the opening
round, all matches being very close. Then
Murchison 3-3 went under to Nagambie
on 11-16, with G. Adams, B. Finnigan, N.
Hourigan and K. Delahey mentioned for
Murch.

## Netball

Robyn Lambden, Julie Pearce and Leayne
Hawking were named for Rushworth A-grade,
in a win over Colbo by seven goals. B-grade
also won, with Wendy Jones, Bev Draper,
Cathy Poulson and Gwen “Kealing” showing
out. (Probably Gwen Keally, as spelling was
sometimes guesswork.)

## Carpet Bowls

Rushworth Club was getting out the little
bowls and rolling out carpet, Clive Wootton
presiding, George Kolenaty as secretary-
treasurer. Saluting on opening night were Jeff
Geddes, Mrs Wootton, Bruce Wootton and
Mrs Duke.

## Golf

Most of Rushworth’s golfers jibbed,
because of rain. Did not bother Craig Teasdale
on 42 stableford points, over older brother
Stephen on 37 points. Jean Branson and Peter
Home won a mixed event, as Dot Aitken hit
nearest the pin.

The following week Bob Barlow and
Don Jessup won A-grade. In B-grade, Max
Richards was victorious. Versatile Bruce
Wootton thought he was playing cricket,
hitting 113, before his handicap of 36 was
deducted. Woot’s nett 77 put him in third
place. (I hear he has found his clubs in the
garage and may make a comeback!)

# Rain and more rain in late May of 1974

I have been asked why there are few
references to Murchison, Stanhope and
Girgarre on this page this year. In 1974 there
was almost no news from these towns in the
Rushworth Chronicle. Nagambie news was
shown as the paper covered both Goulburn
and Waranga Shires.

News of the fortnight was all about the
rain and the floods. Rushworth Chronicle had
a double-page spread of photos, including
men at Murchison filling sand-bags under
lights powered by generators and of Ross
Shelmerdine in a small boat trying to reach
his newly-opened but isolated and badly
damaged Mitchelton Winery. The winery
placed a big notice in the following edition
thanking locals for flood relief assistance.

150 mm of rain was recorded at Rushworth
over two days in late May, being six inches
for us old people. The roads to Stanhope and
Tatura were blocked to all traffic for several
days.

A new machine called a Compuwriter,
“programmed by a type-writer keyboard and
a small computer works out the word spacing
for the line length”, was to be installed at the
Chronicle, said to be “the first installation of
this type of machine in Australia”.

## Shire of Waranga

Hopes were high when three regional
Shires supported Murchison East as a good
location for a regional livestock selling
complex, to serve the whole of the Goulburn
Valley.

## Community

For the next summer season of Stanhope
Lifesaving Club, Ann Kittley replaced Len
Armstrong as President, Len seeking to
concentrate on his role as Councillor within
Waranga Shire. (The club was due to resume
in December, but were on standby in May due
to the flooding!)

The new kindergarten opened at
Rushworth, replacing the Anglican Church
hall venue, operated by Beryl Coyle and Ollie
O’Donnell. Foundation kids photographed
and named included Timothy Collard, Liza
Heath, Scott Curnick, Meagan Perry, Dianne
O’Donnell, Anne Greenaway, John Baldwin,
Peter Cheatley, Debbie Rogerson, Shaun
Risstrom, James Cogan, Joanne O’Donnell,
Brendan Horne, Chris Garvey, “Brenda”
(Brendan, I suspect) Roberts, Kelly Cameron,
and an angelic-looking Angela Barlow. (I
know John Baldwin has sadly passed, but
how can all these other little kids now be 54?)

Waranga Memorial Hospital street
stall had raffles heavily disguised as
“competitions”. Terry Gleeson took home the
boxed towels to give to his mother Mary and
Ian Borger won the box of groceries.

## Personal

Barber Peter Radanov retired from
business, in or next to the shop now known
as Balloons and Stuff. (Fishing was Peter’s
favourite topic when cutting your hair. He
loved fishing and some of those who drove
him out to the Basin were favoured with free
trims. Yabbies were his preferred bait.)

Mrs Annie Stewart of Rushworth died.
She was the grandmother of several, including
readers Sheena Daykin (nee Weaver) and
Graeme and Robert Wall.

Fred Wall, 87, of Seymour and formerly
of Rushworth, died. He was the paternal
grandfather of Graeme and Robert Wall.
If attending Philomena Stewart’s kitchen
tea at Wanalta, gifts were desired to be
coloured teak and oatmeal. (I could not
possibly have made that up!)

## Football

In both the Goulburn Valley and Kyabram
District footy, one round was cancelled due to
flooded grounds.

Colbo went to the top of the ladder and
favourites for the flag, kicking 9-15 to beat
Tooborac 5-7. Mentioned were McCubbery,
I. Reid, Hammond, F. Stewart, B. and P.
Tuohey, Slimmons, Albiston, McEvoy and
Emsley, which was half the team.

Colbo Seconds were nine points behind in
the last quarter but rallied to win 5-12 to 5-3,
with Trevor Cheatley booting two goals, and
Kevin McTaggart, Bill and Trevor Johnson
named as best.

Without injured captain-coach Alec Horne
(replaced by Geoff Hawking) and losing
Mick O’Sullivan (crook neck) and Warren
McKeown at half-time, Rushworth were up
against it, scoring 12-9 to Heathcote’s 18-11.
Big Heathcote wood-cutter Denis Pangrazio
kicked six goals, as the Saints ran away in the
last quarter. Three goals each to Ian Williams
and Ian Cruz, joined in best players noted by
Alf Raglus as John Raglus, Ross Williams,
David Farrer, David Perry, Bill and Herb
Barlow.

Rushworth Seconds scored 9-6 to beat
Heathcote 5-1, goal-sneakers being Lurch
Hoyling and Neville Thompson with two
each. Named as best were Neville, David
Roberts, Geoff Wall, Ian Cruz and R. Jackson.

Rushworth Seniors were successful over
Elmore, 12-16 to 10-7, with Bob Hurley
again in the goals with four. Alf reported best
players as Glen Heily, Ross Williams, Roger
Barnes, Herb Barlow, John Lambden and
Alec Horne.

## Golf

There was no golf played one weekend
at Rushworth as parts of the course were
submerged (and some players could not
swim)! The following weekend Bob Barlow
and Jack Laurie won, over neighbours
Gordon Raglus and J. P. Williams.

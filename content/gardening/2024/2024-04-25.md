# Don’t ‘Doh!’

Isn’t it wonderful to be able to get out
in the garden with the cooler weather. Most
gardeners are busy pulling any weeds that
have survived the summer….and pulling out
the fatalities that didn’t. It is an ideal time to
take stock and set in train a few changes.

Firstly, don’t just replace the dead plants
with more of the same. They will probably
die next summer. I call this Homer Simpson
gardening. If you are going to replace a dead
plant with the same plant you need to work
out why it died. Wrong plant in the wrong
spot? Does it require a watering system?
Did you plant it too late for it to establish a
good root system before
things dried off? Was
it weakened by disease
or bugs? Sort out the
problem so you don’t
go ‘Doh!’ if it dies next
summer.

We are so used to
controlling the things
in our lives. It is a big
mistake to force your
will on your garden. Just
because you like a plant and want it in your
garden, it doesn’t mean it will grow there. For
example, I have been trying to grow some tea
camelias in my garden with no success (ie.
they die). My garden is just too dry and hot
over summer and the soil is probably a little
alkaline and needing more organic matter.
I would like to try again, perhaps in pots,
but I have accepted that camelias just won’t
survive in my garden, even in shade.

In Rushworth we make the mistake of
planting in the spring. If you leave it until
spring, the plant will not be well established
before the summer hits them. It may be better
to plant things now. There will be enough
warmth in the soil and enough daylight for
them to make a start before the cold weather
and they will be ready to race away in the
spring. It is easier to give them the odd
watering until the rains start than it is to keep
newly planted plants watered over the long
summer.

Many gardens have a ‘death spot’ where
nothing seems to grow. Everything you plant
there either fails to thrive or dies. Don’t
just keep replanting. Take a soil sample to a
nursery and get it pH tested. Something as
simple as using a cement mixer can cause
the area around it to become highly alkaline.
Add a heap of compost and if that doesn’t
neutralize the pH, use
powdered iron sulphate (one
handful per square metre).
Try planting plants that
can tolerate high pH soil.
Look these up in the most
comprehensive gardening
manual (Google). If your
soil is acidic (low pH) add
some lime.

It is a good time to assess
how your watering system
has worked. Did it adequately water all the
plants? Do some of the sprays or drips need
replacing or repositioning? My Garden Guru
does not use the polythene piping on our
watering systems. She uses garden hoses.
They are flexible, easily repositioned and
are easily connected to a tap. The sprays and
drips are installed as per the polythene pipe
version.

Accept that a fraction of new plants will
die for whatever reason, but remember that
if you replace them, only a fraction of those
replacements will die. Eventually your garden
will be full of plants….but only if you don’t
do a ‘Homer Simpson’.

# Enjoying autumn

Not surprisingly autumn is voted the favourite season of so many gardeners - the days are usually sunny but just pleasantly
warm, and there’s that little bit of freshness in
the morning air. It doesn’t take much to entice
us outside where it’s so enjoyable that attend-
ing to the many garden chores doesn’t seem at all onerous.

But as well as being a pleasant time of year
it’s also quite a busy period in the garden. We
need to finish clearing out those tired looking
summer veggies and to add some organic
manures into the beds to prepare for winter
crops. This could be compost, manures, even
some autumn leaves will add to the mix soon.
Another way to get organic matter into the
soil is to sow a green manure crop. Special
green manure mixes of efficient nitrogen-
fixing plants can be purchased, or you can use

old left-over seed you might have (especially
legumes), and just sprinkle it thickly and
water well. Before it flowers or sets seed just

dig it over and work it into the soil - or you
can even just leave it on top of the soils and
cover with more compost. (Also a very handy
use for those leftover sprouting seeds you buy
to add to your salad!)
Perennial plants and herbs, such as
salvias, oregano and lemon balm can now
be cut back to new growth to prevent them
becoming woody.
As we have mentioned over the past
few weeks, it’s also an excellent time to be
planting out new trees and shrubs, especially
natives, as the soil is still warm but the days
not so hot as to stress the newly transplanted
specimens. If well-watered and mulched now
they will get off to a good start and acclimatise
well before the winter cold sets in.
And as we have also mentioned - an
excellent place to find those local trees and
shrubs ready to plant out in your garden is the
Goulburn Valley Tree Nursery in Tatura.

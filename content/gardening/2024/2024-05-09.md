# Olive Harvesting....and more

No autumn rains have graced our gardens
over the last few weeks. There are some
brisk mornings and stunning autumn days,
that’s why it’s my favourite time of year!

It’s a busy time in the garden getting all
those spring flowering bulbs in, planting
trees and shrubs, getting as much manure and
compost onto the beds for the next growing
season and the raking and spreading of leaf
mulch just to name a few jobs on the list.

The intense autumn colour is abound on
our ornamental grapevines and deciduous
trees are giving us an extended show this
year.

With olives harvested over the last few
weeks it’s time to give them a hard prune to
keep them in check and at a height that won’t
need a ladder to harvest in the future. If you
have had an abundant crop (some haven’t
this year), try pickling with the salt and press
method and the olives can go into some
vacuum bags with olive oil and some herbs
and then shared with family and friends.

Quinces have been productive also this
year with good yields so some quince paste is
also on the list to do!

It’s a good time to plant garlic, broad
beans, broccoli, leeks, beetroot and other
vegetable for winter/spring harvest giving
them a good start while the ground still has
some warmth in it, not forgetting to give
them a fortnightly liquid feed through their
growing season.

Prune salvias as they get tired looking to
giving them a healthy burst of new growth,
I also prune off all the long growth on my
fruit trees keeping them within a manageable
height and shape.

Enjoy the autumn days......

_Happy Gardening_

# Chinese gambling

Gambling by Chinese immigrants was
usually described in negative terms by the
press of the goldrush era. Terminology
included phrases such as “gambling dens”,
“unlawful games” and “gang of Chinese
gamblers”. The reality was that people of
virtually all ethnic backgrounds engaged
in gambling on the goldfields, of one form
or another.

China had a long history of gambling.
Chinese immigrants (before and during
the goldrush) brought their own games
with them, but also tried other games that
were new to them. It is likely that some
European miners reciprocated by trying
games that the Chinese had introduced to
them.

## Victorian attitudes

Although gambling on horse-racing
had been common in Victoria since
European settlers arrived in numbers from
the 1830s, and other forms of gambling
(cards, dice etc) were tolerated, there was a
lot of anti-gambling sentiment. Much of it
came from Protestant clergy and moralists
who thought that gambling constituted
anti-social behaviour, was likely to water
down the work ethic and would inevitably
lead to a degradation of moral values.

Government felt under pressure to
regulate gambling, in part to try and
ensure that any gambling that did occur
was carried out in a fair and equitable way.
In 1852, the infant Victorian Government
introduced the wonderfully named Act to
Restrain the Practice of Gambling and the
Use of Obscene Language. At the same
time, The Vagrant Act prohibited gambling
on “unlawful games” and in public places.
Anyone arrested for doing so could come
under what was then a broad definition of
a vagrant and be fined or gaoled.

In part, this legislation was used to
vilify and harass the Chinese. Some of
the so-called “unlawful games” were those
that had a long history of being played
by Chinese people. Newspapers from
the last half of the 19th century contain
a litany of stories about raids on Chinese
gambling “dens”. In the 1860s, police
were sometimes paid bonuses for arresting
Chinese gamblers and those running such
institutions. No such problems for horse-
racing, which was controlled by the ruling
classes of the day.

## Types of gambling

One of the oldest card games much
enjoyed by the Chinese diggers was Fan
Tan, also known as “Sevens”. In the game,
the object is to get rid of all your cards
first. The player who does so wins the pot.
Players place a chip in the pot at the start
of the game and each round where they
cannot make a move (i.e. place a card).

Faro was another old card game that
was once played regularly, but these days
in casinos it has been replaced by poker.
In 1865, a raid in the Little Bourke Street
Chinatown precinct led to 25 men being
charged with playing a version of Faro,
which was illegal at the time. They were
each fined 10/-, with the alleged organisers
copping £5 fines.

There were also variations of lotto
games, such a Pah-ah-pu. In this game,
the player buys a ticket with 85 printed
Chinese characters, on which they mark
ten. Pre-determined prizes are given to
anyone who selects at least five correct
characters, with prizes rising progressively
for those with six to ten correct characters.
Other Chinese games such as Mahjong and
Pai Gow (the latter using 32 dominoes as
part of the game) could also be used as a
basis for betting.

These days, apart from some gaming
that occurs in casinos in Macau and Hong
Kong, gambling is largely banned in
China. No doubt it still occurs at the local
level as a form of entertainment.
Waranga goldfields

Although there is little newspaper
coverage of Chinese gambling in the local
area during the goldrush, it is likely that
it would have been a common occurrence.
Whether this amounted to addiction, which
was a generalised claim made in some
newspapers, is debatable. In any case, it
did not seem to affect the work ethic of
most Chinese diggers, who were generally
considered to be most hard-working ethnic
group in their pursuit of gold.

Similarly, in a male-dominated society
with few other sources of entertainment,
the European diggers were drawn to
different forms of gambling. More often
than with the Chinese, this gambling would
be accompanied by alcohol consumption,
with its potential to fuel arguments and
possible violence.

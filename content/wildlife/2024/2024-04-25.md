# Koala Rescue

We have been very busy at Bohollow
attending rescues back to back. The days start
early and the calls continue late into the night.
We have had two cases on active firegrounds
recently. One a few weeks ago and one on
Sunday - both koalas. The first was a poor
female koala who was found by fire-fighters
at the base of a tree on fireground at Ulupna
Island. She had two small blister burns on one
hind foot but besides smoke inhalation and
being extremely subdued, she seemed alright.
Burns are challenging wounds to deal with as
the extent of damage is not always evident
at the beginning. The following day, the two
blisters had progressed to the entire pad of
her hind foot which eventually came right off
leaving a very red, raw, foot which required
dressings and wound treatment.

Over the next few days her other hind foot
began to show signs of burns coming to the
surface. Both hind feet were treated and I’m
happy to say are healing nicely with fresh new
skin. One of her hands, more than five days
later erupted with a now visible burn wound
as well which meant more treatment and
dressings. She is coping well with her time
in care and we expect she will make a full
recovery. Once her wounds are completely
healed, she will be returned to her wild home.
On Sunday we were called to an injured koala
who was still eight metres up a gum tree but
was showing signs of a leg injury. Although
he was unwell, getting the feisty boy to give
up his comfortable perch in a fork in the tree
trunk and come to ground wasn’t an easy task.

After a lengthy battle with my rescue
poles and nets, eventually resorting to putting
our big extension ladder up so I had a bit
more control over stopping him from going
even higher, we managed to persuade the
irritable koala that down was the best way to
go. Once safely packed for transport we took
him back to our Kotupna shelter where Deb
and I confirmed he does have a leg injury
so he is currently settling into care with an
x-ray planned for this week to check for any
fractures that we may not have been able to
pick up due to swelling. Both these animals
came off bushfire ground where the fires were
extremely slow burning.

The canopy was not burnt at all, both fires
moving slowly across the bushland floor.
The Ulupna fire was one of a number of fires
which were deliberately lit, while it has not
been determined how the Coomboona fire was
started. This demonstrates how devastating
even a low, slow moving fire can be for
wildlife. Most birds and animals are able to
move out of the way before they get burnt but
both these koalas got injured moving across
hot ground. They weren’t burnt in the initial
fire but got injured traversing across the hot
earth once the fire had passed through. Spare
a thought for any ground dwelling insects,
spiders, reptiles, etc which may not have been
able to clear out in time or find an adequate
hiding place to shelter from the heat and fire.

Fire, even slow burns, can be devastating for
the immediate ecosystem which is burnt.

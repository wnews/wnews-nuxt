# Educating about Flying Foxes

I saw a comment on social media a couple
of days ago regarding the flying fox colony in
Numurkah. ‘Stinking damn things’ and ‘they
were never this far south, they were only ever
associated with Queensland’, was their first
comment.

I replied that grey-headed flying foxes
have been recorded as south as Melbourne for
100 years or more and they are a protected,
endangered species in Victoria. The reply
this prompted continued the obligatory rant
about flying foxes being disgusting creatures,
they can kill us with lyssavirus and Hendra so
should not be protected at all.

I view education an important part of our
role here at Bohollow and sometimes that can
be a tough gig when faced with people who
have opinions such as the ones mentioned.
It doesn’t matter what facts I present, they
believe they are right and shall not be swayed.
For every person who refuses to be educated,
there are those of us who never stop learning
and for that, I am grateful.

Australian lyssavirus is basically our
strain of rabies. It is carried by less than 1
% of healthy bats and it’s thought maybe
between 5 to 10 % of sick bats. This is why
wildlife rescuers and carers who specialise in
bats should be vaccinated.

Roughly 12 years ago, we actually had a
little red flying fox come into care after being
found on the ground in Kyabram. Deb got
bitten. The bat died the following morning.
Although she was already vaccinated, Deb
still went to get post-bite booster shots just
in case, as the bat was displaying symptoms
which could have been lyssa so we couldn’t
rule it out. We sent the bat to pathology
testing in Melbourne and got word back the
following day that the bat did in fact have
lyssavirus which was the cause of its death.

Little red and grey-headed flying foxes as
well as the yellow-bellied Sheathtail bat are
species found in Victoria which have been
found to carry the virus. Lyssa can only be
transmitted through saliva of an infected bat
entering the bloodstream through an open cut
or wound. This is why you should never pick
up an injured or sick bat directly, just in case.
Chances are many times higher that you may
get killed in a vehicle accident than ever die
of lyssavirus from a bat.

Hendra has never been transmitted from a
bat to a person. Flying foxes are believed to
be the vectors of Hendra. This means when a
horse ingests urine or faeces of a bat infected
with Hendra, the horse then can become a
transmitter to humans. I do not know of any
Victorian cases of Hendra to date.

Interestingly, Hendra does not appear to
make bats sick. The benefits of bats in our
environment far outweigh the extremely
small risk of ever contracting either Lyssa or
Hendra Virus.

Flying foxes are an important pollinator
of our native forests, distributing seeds quite
long distances as they can fly distances of 50
km in a night and are highly mobile during
their foraging activities.

Our microbats are roughly mouse size
and we have many different species in this
area. They eat up to half their bodyweight
in insects during a single night and are
important in controlling insect numbers such
as mosquitoes.

We are much more likely to contract a
nasty virus such as Ross River virus from a
mosquito than catching something from a bat.
These creatures have been in the Australian
environment for longer than humans have
and have always moved around the continent,
altering roost sites depending on food and
climate.

Since the first population surveys ever
done in the 1920’s, Flying fox numbers
Australia wide have radically declined
predominantly due to habitat loss.

Bats are the only mammal which have
evolved independent flight like birds, which
I think makes them unique and pretty special.

We need to live alongside our native
wildlife and stop vilifying them whenever
they inconvenience our lives . . . after all, if
you look at the big picture, it is really us who
have inconvenienced wildlife a lot more by
destroying and altering their natural homes.

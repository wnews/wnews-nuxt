Most of the prisoners were from the Australian 22nd Infantry     Battalion. They had been in the force which had unsuccessfully tried to     repel the Japanese invasion of New Britain. Many of the men in the battalion     had their roots in the Goulburn Valley, including several with a Stanhope     connection.

There was nothing to indicate that the ship was     carrying prisoners of war. Over 1000 Australians died in the sinking, making     it the worst maritime disaster in Australian history. Most of the men who     were locked below deck never had a chance. Some of those who did get into     the water and were clinging to wreckage sang “Auld Lang Syne” as the ship     sank.

However, it was also important to remember those who were lost     and provide some solace for all those families who were directly affected.     Families and local RSL clubs had the opportunity to place wreaths of     remembrance beneath the mural.

George Gemmill Secretary gave a summary of the sinking of the ship     and named some of the local families who were connected with those on board     the ship who lost their lives. 22 of the Brunswick Salvation Army Band were     included in these numbers.

The Preston Salvation Army Band, who were invited because of     their close connection with this tragedy, delighted the large crowd. Lindsay     Cox, Salvation Army Museum manager, was guest speaker for the day. Many     families and RSL branches laid floral tributes in memory.

There was plenty of talk as well as an     opportunity to view displays of memorabilia. Many people are now visiting     Stanhope to view the memorial. Their understanding of this poignant story     will be greatly enhanced by the new plaque and information boards. The     organising committee expressed thanks to all who contributed to making the     day the success that it was, and also to the Campaspe Shire for the     sponsorship.

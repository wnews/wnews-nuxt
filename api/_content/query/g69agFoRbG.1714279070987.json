The fact that    Ambrose was selected means that he was probably an excellent horseman,    skilled marksman and capable of “living rough”. His unit, along with their    horses, left Melbourne on the “Eurayalus” in March 1900 for the sea journey    of a little over three weeks.

Ambrose returned to Australia in June 1901, having completed a    full tour of duty. During his first period of service, Australia had become    a federated country, rather than a collection of British colonies. The first    Australian units were put together to go and serve in the South African War.    Ambrose signed up again, enlisting as a Private (No 2245) with the 4th    Australian Commonwealth Horse.

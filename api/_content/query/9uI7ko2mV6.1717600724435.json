It is a big\nmistake to force your\nwill on your garden. Just\nbecause you like a plant and want it in your\ngarden, it doesn’t mean it will grow there. For\nexample, I have been trying to grow some tea\ncamelias in my garden with no success (ie.\nthey die). My garden is just too dry and hot\nover summer and the soil is probably a little\nalkaline and needing more organic matter.\nI would like to try again, perhaps in pots,\nbut I have accepted that camelias just won’t\nsurvive in my garden, even in shade."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In Rushworth we make the mistake of\nplanting in the spring. If you leave it until\nspring, the plant will not be well established\nbefore the summer hits them. It may be better\nto plant things now. There will be enough\nwarmth in the soil and enough daylight for\nthem to make a start before the cold weather\nand they will be ready to race away in the\nspring.

Everything you plant\nthere either fails to thrive or dies. Don’t\njust keep replanting. Take a soil sample to a\nnursery and get it pH tested. Something as\nsimple as using a cement mixer can cause\nthe area around it to become highly alkaline.\nAdd a heap of compost and if that doesn’t\nneutralize the pH, use\npowdered iron sulphate (one\nhandful per square metre).\nTry planting plants that\ncan tolerate high pH soil.\nLook these up in the most\ncomprehensive gardening\nmanual (Google).

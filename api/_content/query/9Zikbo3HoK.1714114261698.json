For instance, Waranga = sing; Whroo = lips or mouth (presumably in relation to drinking from the waterhole); Corop = call of the brolga; Colbinabbin = meeting of red and black soils; Carag Carag = magpie; Nagambie = lagoon or still water; Tatura = place of small lagoons; Kyabram = thick forest.

As an example, Girgarre has been listed in various publications as meaning ‘sour’, ‘red earth’ and ‘edible root’.  Echuca is generally thought to mean ‘meeting of the waters’ (i.e. the confluence of the Murray and Campaspe Rivers) but in some publications it is said to relate to gravel beds in the river which are visible when flows are very low.  Burramboot could be ‘high hill’ or ‘muddy water’, both of which are quite feasible given the location."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Aboriginal names There are plenty of geographical features and localities that currently have European names, but for which Aboriginal names have been recorded.  The confluence of rivers would seem to be of great significance to Aboriginal people in that most of the major ones in and around Ngurai-illum Wurrung country seem to have a name.  Perhaps they were meeting places and/or important locations along the local songlines."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The junction of the Campaspe and Coliban Rivers (now under Lake Eppalock) was known as yallemeeboon; Campaspe/Murray = yalka or echuca; Goulburn/Broken = marangan; Goulburn/Murray = koninner.  Some of these names were probably from languages other than Ngurai-illum Wurrung, whose people were aware of them and may have had their own particular name for them.  Rivers often had multiple names, depending on whose country they were passing through.  Parts of rivers were also assigned particular names in some cases."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Mount Camel has great significance for the Ngurai-illum Wurrum people who, according to some sources, called it Yiberithoop.  Below the Mount Camel Range, Lake Cooper was called Pawbeenbolock/Paboinboolok (where bulluk = lake), while some researchers say the name was Tangalum/Tongillum (where yillam = camp).  It is easy to envision the people camping on the lake shores where there would be an abundance of food in most seasons. Before it became Gunn’s Swamp, then Waranga Basin, the wetlands that are now covered by the Basin are recorded as having been called Baangyoobine."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The links between places The European colonial way is to regard places of habitation and their names as quite distinct and those distinctions are often reinforced to the nth degree by mindless parochialism.

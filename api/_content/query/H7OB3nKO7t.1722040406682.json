It was likely that very few of those involved in    this first rush were Chinese. There was a time lapse between the gold    discoveries, word filtering back to China, then entrepreneurs organising    people and the shipping required to bring them out to Australia. Numbers    would have peaked later in the 1850s.      From mid-1859 to mid-1860, when gold-seeking populations had settled down to    a degree, the numbers of Chinese on the Waranga goldfields fluctuated    between 150 and 250. The reports listed the Chinese separately from other    men, women and children, as though the Chinese were another species that did    not fit into those three categories.

The increase in quartz    mining on an industrial scale, as compared to alluvial mining, would have    significantly contributed to this. Meanwhile, the Chinese were still largely    employed in alluvial mining. Around this time, there were usually 60-70    puddling machines in operation (when water was available). The vast majority    of these were operated by the Chinese miners. It is hard to know how much    gold they were finding, because there were multiple ways of disposing of the    product of their labours. Much gold was transported by the weekly armed gold    escort, which took gold from the Waranga goldfields to Heathcote initially,    then on to Melbourne. However, it was suspected that much of the gold mined    by the Chinese unofficially found its way back to China through a variety of    methods. As well as ordinary money, gold was basically legal tender, so    could also be used to purchase food and supplies. The result of this was    that a fair proportion was in circulation in the local economy at any time.      The early and spectacular successes with alluvial mining on the Waranga    goldfields were largely over by 1860. To be successful required patience and    persistence, a systematic approach and long hours of hard work. The Chinese    miners generally displayed these characteristics to a greater degree than    their western counterparts."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"highly-mobile","depth":2,"text":"Highly mobile"},{"id":"success","depth":2,"text":"Success"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:immigration:2023:list:early-arrival-and-success.md","_source":"content","_file":"immigration/2023/list/early-arrival-and-success.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/immigration/2024/2024-05-23","_dir":"2024","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Opium use","description":"Some of the Chinese immigrants in the\nWaranga area were opium users.

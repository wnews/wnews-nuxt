Brown Falcons are raucous raptors who vocalise a lot which can make them easy to identify in the sky. They prey on a variety of other critters including other birds, reptiles, small mammals, large insects and amphibians. The reptiles these raptors willingly hunt include snakes which is pretty impressive. They will also eat carrion which often causes them to be hit on roads while they are eating roadkill.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":48,"children":49},{},[50],{"type":22,"value":51},"Another reason they are prone to getting hit on the roads is because they often frequent roadsides, choosing powerlines or fence posts to perch on.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":53,"children":54},{},[55],{"type":22,"value":56},"These birds usually breed and lay their eggs from August to October and use an old nest made of sticks which was previously built and used by Ravens or another species of raptor. Clutches are generally two to three eggs but may be up to five or as low as one. The eggs take around 33 days to hatch. Both parents share the job of incubation as well as brooding the young chicks although the female bird performs these duties more often than the male as he does most of the hunting. She will leave the nest to take food from him either in midair or from a nearby perch then take it back to feed the chicks.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":58,"children":59},{},[60],{"type":22,"value":61},"The chicks are ready to leave the nest within five to six weeks and once fledged can remain dependant on their parents to assist them in hunting for a further 6 weeks though individual birds may become successful independent hunters sooner than this.

Release involves ‘hacking out’, which is an old falconry term for releasing a raptor while it is still dependent and coming back in to you for food while they are honing their hunting skills.

Phillip Island and other islands in Bass Strait and South East Australia are home to breeding colonies of these remarkable birds. Colonies can range from several hundred pairs to over a million pairs on these islands!

They are excellent flyers but take offs are tricky as they need to leave from the height of rocks and cliffs so if they come to ground on land, they get stranded. The chicks make their migration on their own as their parents leave a few weeks earlier. The chicks are well fed up to their parents leaving and their last parental feed has to last them for about three weeks when they too begin to leave in large numbers, heading north. Winds have to be present to aid in their departure but still many birds come down before getting away from the coastal land areas. The lights on the bridge to Phillip Island are actually turned off at night during migration to help the birds leave the coast as lights disorientate them and can cause them to ground or flock around the lights. Lower speed limits are also enforced as so many of them end up on the roads. There is a rescue unit dedicated to assist grounded shearwaters during this time at Phillip Island and grounded birds are taken back to the coast to give them a second chance at taking off without mishap. The adult birds are much more experienced which means the majority of birds rescued are fledglings.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":117,"children":118},{},[119],{"type":22,"value":120},"Shearwaters can fly up to 40 knots and are excellent divers. Using their wings to propel them along underwater they can dive up to 50m but most dives are about 20m. They eat krill and crustaceans. They nest in long sandy burrows and only lay one egg each breeding season. Adult birds goout at sea during daylight, returning on dark to feed their chicks.

This bird was in my care for less than 24 hours as I got it down to the Marine Response Unit the following day where it could be looked after and released again back on the coast with other juveniles. These birds do not feed on their own while in captivity so the entire time they are in care they require being tubed blended up fish. Not the most glamorous job in the world but is worth it to give these beautiful birds a second chance.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":132,"children":133},{},[134],{"type":22,"value":135},"This shearwater weighed in at 610g which is perfect weight for a juvenile short-tailed shearwater so I am hoping he was able to released pretty much immediately and wish him the best for his epic flight to Alaska.

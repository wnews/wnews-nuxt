They will defend their territory to the death if they discover an intruder. Generally a male may have one or a few female birds in their territory who they will father chicks with, although they usually only assist one of these females in nesting duties. Young magpies are looked after by parent or parents for quite a few months. Female young are sometimes allowed to stay in the home territory until they find their own mate and venture further afield but male young are generally evicted from the home range and will join up in small flocks with other males who will often float around the edges of breeding territories, kind of like a magpie no man’s land, until they themselves establish a partnership with a female and begin protecting their own nesting territory.

This is because they see humans as one of their own and what do magpies do to one of their own kind when one enters their territory. They beat it up and try to kill it if it doesn’t vacate quickly.

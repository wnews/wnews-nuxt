The magpie in this case was obtained by picking it up as a brancher/fledgling, just as many people do, with the assumption or story that it was ‘abandoned’ by its parents. The Gold Coast couple did not contact local wildlife rescue for assistance and this bird was raised alongside dogs and people, becoming humanised and treated as a pet bird.","/gallery/2024/03/wnews20240328-062.jpg",{"type":13,"children":14},"root",[15,23],{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":18,"children":20},"element","h1",{"id":19},"aussie-magpie",[21],{"type":22,"value":9},"text",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":25,"children":26},"p",{},[27],{"type":22,"value":10},{"type":13,"children":29,"toc":151},[30,34,38,43,48,53,58,66,71,76,81,86,91,96,101,106,111,116,121,126,131,136,141,146],{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":31,"children":32},{"id":19},[33],{"type":22,"value":9},{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":35,"children":36},{},[37],{"type":22,"value":10},{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":39,"children":40},{},[41],{"type":22,"value":42},"Right from the word go this couple have created digital content in the form of a social media page which includes ongoing videos of the magpie interacting with both them and their dog as part of the family.

They will defend their territory to the death if they discover an intruder. Generally a male may have one or a few female birds in their territory who they will father chicks with, although they usually only assist one of these females in nesting duties. Young magpies are looked after by parent or parents for quite a few months. Female young are sometimes allowed to stay in the home territory until they find their own mate and venture further afield but male young are generally evicted from the home range and will join up in small flocks with other males who will often float around the edges of breeding territories, kind of like a magpie no man’s land, until they themselves establish a partnership with a female and begin protecting their own nesting territory. Some of these males may never actually hold a nesting territory.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":97,"children":98},{},[99],{"type":22,"value":100},"Each season we raise a large number of nestling magpies. Our patients are raised in groups according to age and size. As soon as they are of fledgling age they are moved to outdoor enclosures which give them enough room to fly and strengthen their wings.

Usually there are one or two who seek out human companionship even after being released and may try to sneak in an open door of the house. These are often birds a member of public has kept for a period of time and tried to raise before handing in to the shelter. These birds eventually cease that behaviour as, although we will interact with them if they land on us or seek us out, we do not take those interactions any further and do not encourage humanised behaviour so in the end, the need to seek us out disappears.

Often not to the people who raised them but to every visitor or passer-by in what they see as their territory. This is because they see humans as one of their own and what do magpies do to one of their own kind when one enters their territory. They beat it up and try to kill it if it doesn’t vacate quickly. Over the years, we have rehabilitated quite a number of magpies which people have raised and kept for a few years then contacted us to take the bird in to rehabilitation due the bird becoming aggressive with visitors. The other common reason for people contacting us is that when they tried to release the bird, it has almost been killed by their resident magpies.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":137,"children":138},{},[139],{"type":22,"value":140},"These birds end up spending more time in care than would have initially been necessary and some, sadly, because they have health issues that were not addressed when needed or have had poor diet and housing leading to incurable conditions, have to be euthanised and we are the ones who have to deal with that, not the people who caused the problems in the first instance.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":142,"children":143},{},[144],{"type":22,"value":145},"The moral to this story is if you find injured or orphaned wildlife, regardless of how cute, cuddly, or cool it is to have an animal bond with you or interact with you in a way you did not think possible, regardless of all the emotions this evokes within you or your children, please do the right thing by the animal and contact the nearest wildlife rescue service or shelter.",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":147,"children":148},{},[149],{"type":22,"value":150},"These animals deserve the chance to get back out into the wild in a way that gives them the best chance possible at surviving out there.

The colder weather usually brings less food sources for birds of prey with rodents and other prey species becoming quite scarce. The shorter days mean less hunting hours for our diurnal raptor species although for our nocturnal species such as the owls, it’s obviously the opposite. To survive the colder weather they are burning up more energy and if they have not entered into winter with good weight on, winter becomes very dangerous indeed.",{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":28,"children":29},{},[30],{"type":21,"value":31},"Juvenile raptors face their first winter hunting on their own without the assistance of parents and if they have not quite perfected the skills they need to keep good weight on, they quickly succumb to the elements.",{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":33,"children":34},{},[35],{"type":21,"value":36},"Winter is also a great time to see our native birds of prey. During nesting time, they are often quite secretive and not seen as frequently unless you are lucky enough to have one nesting nearby. In the colder months falcons can be seen resting on fenceposts and power lines, hawks begin to hunt around residential areas where the pickings are easier to flush out and our owls also seem to gravitate to roadsides.",{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":38,"children":39},{},[40],{"type":21,"value":41},"The male Collared Sparrowhawk is one of our smallest birds of prey.

Usually taking small birds, once flushed out, they will actively chase them down. They are like a cheetah in the chase, it all happens very quickly and if they are unsuccessful over a short distance of pursuit, they will usually peel away and give up.

They are extremely instinct driven birds but also possess an unpredictable crazy element. Their eyes say it all. If I had to describe them in human terms, it would be that they have googly, crazy, racer eyes. Anyone who knows any professional racing car or motorcycle racers will know exactly what I mean!

Many bird species can knock themselves out on windows. Sometimes this is caused by the bird catching sight of its own reflection in the glass and believing it is a rival to be attacked and driven off. In the Sparrowhawks case, I believe these collisions occur through taking a wrong turn at speed while in pursuit of prey and suddenly being stopped short by a window.",{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":58,"children":59},{},[60],{"type":21,"value":61},"An impact from hitting a window may not seem so drastic but for many birds, it actually causes death.

Usually the lighter coloured the bird is, especially around the head and neck, the younger it is. People often think size is the key to identifying the age of a bird and I wish it was that easy, but the reality is that most birds are full size or close to full size by the age they begin to fly. Younger birds can be a very very light, bleached blonde colour around the head and neck to a light golden colour and everything in between, then as the bird ages this colouration darkens to a beautiful rufous red. Eventually after five plus years, the bird becomes more of a uniform dark chocolate brown/black with a dark head and neck. This is what we consider a mature bird which is at least 5 years old.

An eagle’s diet consists of around 80 percent carrion. Carrion is the term used to describe already deceased animals. They much prefer to feed on recently killed road carrion or recently deceased stock laying in a paddock. Although they certainly can and do take live lambs, studies show that the amount they actually kill is usually as little as 1 percent of stock so is quite negligible. It is far more beneficial to a farmer to have eagles frequently their properties cleaning up dying or deceased stock and also as an apex predator they are extremely important member of a healthy environment.

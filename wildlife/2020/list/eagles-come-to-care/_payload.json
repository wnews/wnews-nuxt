Usually the lighter coloured the bird is, especially around the head and neck, the younger it is. People often think size is the key to identifying the age of a bird and I wish it was that easy, but the reality is that most birds are full size or close to full size by the age they begin to fly. Younger birds can be a very very light, bleached blonde colour around the head and neck to a light golden colour and everything in between, then as the bird ages this colouration darkens to a beautiful rufous red. Eventually after five plus years, the bird becomes more of a uniform dark chocolate brown/black with a dark head and neck. This is what we consider a mature bird which is at least 5 years old. Once they reach this mature colour, it is basically impossible to tell their age.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":38,"children":39},{},[40],{"type":21,"value":41},"Females can be greatly larger than the male eagle which is also a general rule amongst raptor species and are usually the dominant sex in a pair.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":43,"children":44},{},[45],{"type":21,"value":46},"Wedge-tailed eagles still continue to be shot and poisoned due to the uneducated view that they impact on stock numbers, particularly on sheep farms. An eagleâ€™s diet consists of around 80 percent carrion. Carrion is the term used to describe already deceased animals. They much prefer to feed on recently killed road carrion or recently deceased stock laying in a paddock. Although they certainly can and do take live lambs, studies show that the amount they actually kill is usually as little as 1 percent of stock so is quite negligible. It is far more beneficial to a farmer to have eagles frequently their properties cleaning up dying or deceased stock and also as an apex predator they are extremely important member of a healthy environment. Eagles also prefer the introduced rabbit and hare over any other live food source and assist in the control of these on agricultural land.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":48,"children":49},{},[50],{"type":21,"value":51},"Wedge-tail Eagles are currently beginning their courtship and breed for the upcoming season and it will not be long before nests will occupy eggs and young.

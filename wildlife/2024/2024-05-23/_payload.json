They have been a little\nless adaptable to our urban\nenvironments than the Brushies as\nwell, preferring native bushland\nwith hollows to the walls or roof\ncavities of our houses, although\nas more of their natural habitat\nhas been lost, they can also be\nfound in urban areas as well. They\nusually camp out during the day\nin what we call a drey. Their drey\nconsists of a rounded nest made\nfrom leaves, twigs and branches,\nusually either in a hollow or\nplaced within dense foliage of a\ntree or shrub. Unlike the Brush-\ntailed who usually camps alone,\nRing-tailed possums prefer to\ncamp in groups. One male and\nseveral females may occupy the\ndrey, including young females\nborn from the previous couple\nof years. They are predominantly\narboreal (living in trees) but I\nhave seen evidence of the Ring-\ntailed possums on my bushland\nproperty coming to the ground to\ndig up fungi under the surface of\nthe woodland floor.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":38,"children":39},{},[40],{"type":21,"value":41},"Their diet is mainly eucalypt\nleaves and foliage but will also\nmunch on flowers and fruits and\neat both native and introduced\nplants. In some areas they may\nuse human dwellings to rest\nduring the day but it is much rarer\nfor them to be in sheds, wall and\nroof cavities than their Brush-\ntailed cousin. I have not come\nacross Ring-tailed possums in\nour area occupying these spaces\nbut I’m sure it does happen.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":43,"children":44},{},[45],{"type":21,"value":46},"They are not a long lived\nanimal, average lifespan is only\nsix years. Both male and female\npossums help make the drey and\nbreeding usually occurs between\nApril and November. After\nbreeding, almost a month later\nfemales give birth to a tiny, jelly\nbean sized joey which makes its\nway to the pouch and secures to a\nteat. Twins are common in Ring-\ntailed possums. Nourished with\ntheir mother’s milk, after about\nseven weeks the young venture\nfrom the pouch to become what\nwe call back riders, clinging to\nmother’s back while she forages\naround at night.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":48,"children":49},{},[50],{"type":21,"value":51},"Interestingly, the male Ring-\ntailed possum is the only possum\nwe have that will share parental\nduties with the female and young\nmay be transferred to the male’s\nback while the female is eating.\nYoung possums continue to back\nride until around six months of\nage.",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":53,"children":54},{},[55],{"type":21,"value":56},"The most common reasons\nwe see Ring-tailed possums run\ninto trouble and come into care\nare vehicle collisions, cat and\ndog attacks and they can also\nget electrocuted on powerlines\nand transformers. As they are\nterritorial, youngsters who come\ninto care are provided with nesting\nboxes upon release to ensure they\nhave their own drey until they\nfind their way in the world and\ndon’t get evicted immediately\nby resident possums. You can\nhelp these beautiful possums by\ninstalling nesting boxes around\nyour property, keeping cats inside\nand planting native vegetation.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":58,"depth":58,"links":59},2,[],"markdown","content:wildlife:2024:2024-05-23.md","content","wildlife/2024/2024-05-23.md","md",1716765788605]

My children always ask if there is\nanything we can do, the answer is always the\nsame. We tried to stop it.\nThis year is no different. We have tried to\nstop it. We have submitted our concerns to the\nConservation Regulator, the Game Management\nAuthority, ministers and relevant officials to\nno avail. The people who live here, protect\nand respect our unique wetland cannot even\nset foot within 50 metres of the water without\npossessing a hunting licence once the season\nbegins.

No\nfences. One side of the main track is National\nPark, the other side of the main track is\nGame Reserve. Loch Garry was State Forest\nslated to be included in the Lower Goulburn\nNational Park. It was, without any community\nconsultation or transparency, quietly excluded\nfrom the original plans and handed to the Game\nManagement Authority to appease the shooters\nas Reedy Swamp was another wetland which\nbecame protected under the new National\nPark. Reedy Swamp sits right in Shepparton,\nis more visible to the public eye and certainly\nless acceptable to have shooters causing havoc.\nThe locality and isolation of Loch Garry, could\nbe why this is an acceptable shooting ground\nof native species Environmentally, the Loch is\npossibly more important than Reedy for both\nhabitat and diversity of species recorded. When\nwe are faced with constant misdemeanours and\nbad behaviour from shooters, calling officials is\nfaced with, ‘sorry, we do not have the resources\nto send any one out there. Don’t approach them\nyourselves though as they are obviously armed\nand potentially drunk’. Where do we go to get\nassistance? Officials put in a brief appearance\nand once they are gone, the shooters know they\nare free to do as they please.\nIf we wish to protect these environments\nthere needs to be public outcry. Just like our\nforests are disappearing through the death of\na thousand cuts, these areas which are open\nto shooting are dying through the death of a\nthousand shots.\nIt’s cases like this and government decisions\nwhich continue to ignore the evidence that is\nput before them, cause me to ponder whether\nwe have come as far environmentally that we\npurport to have come. From where I stand, I see\ncontinual government support of the destruction\nof our wild places and the native diversity which\ndepend on their protection.\nThis week is indeed a sad time for Victorian\nwetlands.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":67,"depth":67,"links":68},2,[],"markdown","content:wildlife:2024:2024-04-11.md","content","wildlife/2024/2024-04-11.md","md",1712802829980]

The days start\nearly and the calls continue late into the night.\nWe have had two cases on active firegrounds\nrecently. One a few weeks ago and one on\nSunday - both koalas. The first was a poor\nfemale koala who was found by fire-fighters\nat the base of a tree on fireground at Ulupna\nIsland. She had two small blister burns on one\nhind foot but besides smoke inhalation and\nbeing extremely subdued, she seemed alright.\nBurns are challenging wounds to deal with as\nthe extent of damage is not always evident\nat the beginning. The following day, the two\nblisters had progressed to the entire pad of\nher hind foot which eventually came right off\nleaving a very red, raw, foot which required\ndressings and wound treatment.","/gallery/2024/04/wnews20240425-058.jpg",{"type":12,"children":13,"toc":55},"root",[14,22,27,40,45,50],{"type":15,"tag":16,"props":17,"children":19},"element","h1",{"id":18},"koala-rescue",[20],{"type":21,"value":8},"text",{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":24,"children":25},"p",{},[26],{"type":21,"value":9},{"type":15,"tag":23,"props":28,"children":29},{},[30,38],{"type":15,"tag":31,"props":32,"children":37},"img",{"alt":8,"className":33,"src":35,"style":36},[34],"p-4","https://media.wnews.org.au/gallery/2024/04/wnews20240425-058.jpg","float:right",[],{"type":21,"value":39},"\nOver the next few days her other hind foot\nbegan to show signs of burns coming to the\nsurface.

Once her wounds are completely\nhealed, she will be returned to her wild home.\nOn Sunday we were called to an injured koala\nwho was still eight metres up a gum tree but\nwas showing signs of a leg injury.

His son Harry was born in 1873 but it seems that he and Harry’s mother Alice only married in 1897.\\n\",\n\"Travels in Victoria\\n\",\n\"After coming to Victoria, Washbourne set up his business in Wangaratta.  In 1866 he made an application to the Wangaratta Borough Council requesting permission “to erect a tent for photographic purposes”.  This was granted.  Wangaratta people had a chance to see his work when he was awarded a certificate at a local exhibition, with his entries “comprising views of the neighbourhood, and portraits of the aborigines.”1  He had moved his business up to Yackandandah by 1869.  Washbourne later settled in Geelong.  He travelled around many parts of Victoria taking photographs and selling them.  Hopefully his photography was better than his business acumen, because he was declared an insolvent in 1883.\\n\",\n\"Clearly, Washbourne had a fascination with Aboriginal people, and took numerous photographs of them.  Some of these photos of the Ngurai-illum Wurrung people finished up in the British Museum, including the attached wonderful photograph of Jenny and Lizzie wrapped in possum skin cloaks.  The British Museum has a date on the photo of 1870 which is probably the acquisition date.  The photo would have been taken earlier.2  \\n\",\n\"Lizzie’s birth date\\n\",\n\"There was some conjecture about Lizzie’s birth date.  She died in 1957, with the headstone on her grave noting that she was 104.  This would place her birth date around 1853, which is unlikely.  Jenny would only have been about 10 at the time. In some official and unofficial records, Lizzie’s birth date is given as 1857/8.  Her place of birth is uncertain.  Murchison, Avenel and Mangalore are all possibilities.\\n\",\n\"When you look at Washbourne’s photo of the pair, Lizzie looks very young – perhaps 5 or 6 at the most.  This could tie in with Washbourne’s arrival in Australia in 1863, setting up his business in Wangaratta in 1865/6, then travelling in his covered wagon around country Victoria.  Just where the photo was taken is also a matter of conjecture.  Avenel is a possibility, given other oral history stories we have about Jenny and Lizzie.  It is interesting to note that Jenny appears to be wearing a European shirt or dress, covered by a possum skin cloak.  Lizzie’s cloak seems to be small, and traditionally one that would have been added to with extra skins as she grew older and bigger.\\n\",\n\"Coranderrk\\n\",\n\"Aboriginal populations in the local area were decimated in the colonial era, through disease, murder and displacement.  After the closure of the Goulburn River Aboriginal Protectorate at Murchison in 1853, there was really no place for people to congregate until the Coranderrk Aboriginal Station was set up 10 years later.  At some point, Jenny and Lizzie were encouraged to move to Coranderrk.  As noted in the previous story, Jenny married Johnny Phillips there in 1876 and died in 1888.  \",\n\"She is buried in the cemetery at Coranderrk.\\nJohnny Phillips was a Wathaurung man from the Geelong area.  Like Jenny, he would have been strongly encouraged to move to Coranderrk.  When he died in 1901, it was reported that “he belonged to the “old school”, the members of which are slowly but surely becoming extinct.”3  It is clear from this statement that the myth of extinction still persisted in 1901.  One hundred and twenty years later, Victoria still has a strong and proud Aboriginal population, proving just how much of a myth that was.\\n\",\n\"References:  1.

The most obvious man’s name was Tattambo, who was buried in the Murchison cemetery.  Despite retaining his tribal name, he was still labelled with the first name of Charles.  We do not know his first wife’s name and his second wife was only known by the European name of Mary.  Similarly, the people of Murchison knew Tattambo’s sister only as Sarah.  We only know the children of Tattambo and Mary by the names assigned to them by the colonists.\",\n\"Like Tattambo, William Barak, the famous Aboriginal activist, retained part of his original name but took on the first name of William.  His mother, who was a Ngurai-illum Wurrung woman, appears to have only been known by her birth name, Tooteerie.  She was from Tattambo’s generation, which pre-dated colonisation.\",\n\"Less well-known names\",\n\"Other names appear in the literature from the colonial era.  Some of the Ngurai-illum Wurrung names that are mentioned by squatter and writer Edward Curr include Wawgroot, Berrin-Berrin and Kolopka.1\",\n\"When Europeans wrote down names they had encountered, there were often problems with accuracy.  The name may have been heard incorrectly in the first place, then recorded later.  Many of the early colonists were poorly educated, if indeed they had received any education.  As a result, you must take the names at face value, understanding that there may be inaccuracies in spelling and/or pronunciation.  However, they do give us an inkling of what some of the names might have been.\\nMany of the birth names of Aboriginal people could be described as ‘euphonious’, a word rarely used these days, although it always used to appear on the cover of the Yabba, the weekly Heathcote and District FNL program.  It means that the name sounds ‘agreeable, clear, harmonious, mellifluous, melodious, musical, rhythmic’.2  \",\n\"There are lots of great place names around our area that you could put into the euphonious category – Wanalta, Gobarup, Colbinabbin, Burramboot, Waranga, Paboinbalook (Lake Cooper) to name just a few.  It is not much of a stretch to think that many of the individual names could have had a similar quality. \",\n\"Extending the list\",\n\"Dunnolly researcher and historian John Tully has done a lot of work on the Aboriginal people of north central Victoria.  Amongst many other things, he has tried to compile a list of names of people from various language groups, including the Ngurai-illum Wurrung.3  (Incidentally, John also has a different take on the Country of the Ngurai-illum Wurrung people, suggesting that it extended west of the Campaspe River towards Bendigo.  Most researchers consider the Campaspe to be the western boundary.)\",\n\"To collate his list of names, John has done considerable research at the Public Records Office of Victoria, reading firsthand accounts by colonists who encountered Aboriginal people in the very early days of the Port Phillip district settlement before the establishment of the State of Victoria.  This included staff at the so-called Aboriginal Protectorate Stations, of which there was one at Murchison.\",\n\"Where possible, the list shows the traditional name of the individual, but also the European name that they got lumbered with later.  It also shows variations of spelling for the name.  This was because the people doing the recording either heard the name differently or spelt it differently.\",\n\"Some of the interesting names John lists for which he does not have a European equivalent include Chimbri, Dere-rer-cam, Poormaning, Karwitha, Tarparning, Turtool, Orgenangarook, Bucermul, Oneeny and Kolopka.  We do not know if these are men or women or whether the names have any specific meaning.  They do give us hints of a Ngurai-illum Wurrung language that is just hanging on in a much-reduced format.\",\n\"References:  1.  Curr, Edward, The Australian Race, p 527; 2.

This was caused by a combination of factors, including demographic changes (i.e. a severe decline in population), lack of access to Country/home and a rapidly changing economy.  Many of the social changes impacted women.\\nPrior to colonisation, Aboriginal women lived somewhat independently from the men.  There was no economic dependence on the men, because the women were more than capable of providing a balanced diet for themselves and their children.  At times, this would be supplemented by meat coming from the men’s hunting parties, but they were not dependent on this to survive.1\\n\"",{"type":13,"children":119},[120,125],{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":121,"children":123},{"id":122},"women-and-social-change",[124],{"type":22,"value":116},{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":126,"children":127},{},[128],{"type":22,"value":117},{"type":13,"children":130,"toc":144},[131,135,139],{"type":16,"tag":17,"props":132,"children":133},{"id":122},[134],{"type":22,"value":116},{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":136,"children":137},{},[138],{"type":22,"value":117},{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":140,"children":141},{},[142],{"type":22,"value":143},"\"After colonisation, with lack of access to their Country, the women were less capable of providing adequate food supplies, so had to rely on other ways of feeding their families.  To a greater degree, they had to rely on the men’s ability to work and earn “rations”.  European colonisers did not expect that their women had to go out and work.  Rather, their women fulfilled largely domestic roles.  They influenced Aboriginal women who formed part of family groups on stations to do the same.  Rather than playing a very significant role in family life, women’s roles after colonisation could be considerably diminished.\\n\",\n\"Change factors\\n\",\n\"With colonisation, there were many changes that impacted the social lives of Aboriginal women.  The traditional marriage laws broke down, often because the man to whom a young woman was betrothed was already dead through disease, internecine fighting or murder.  \",\n\"There was a drastic shortage of European women in the rural areas, so white men often took Aboriginal women as partners, either by mutual agreement or by force.\\n\",\n\"European colonisers introduced potentially addictive substances such as tobacco and alcohol.  When addiction occurred in Aboriginal families, there was a consequent breakdown in family relations and more potential for physical and sexual violence against the women.2\\n\",\n\"This greater level of violence was also attributable to factors such as the increase in stress levels associated with colonisation in general, the shift in the relative power of men and women within the communities and the anger felt by some of the men when their women co-habited with colonists.\\n\",\n\"Children\\n\",\n\"Removal of children from Aboriginal women started early in Australia.  The concept of Stolen Generations is not new.  “In 1842, John Patterson, in a pamphlet on the condition of the Aboriginal people in the Goulburn River district, advocated the education and disciplining of children after the European fashion.  He believed this to be the only possible way of preventing the complete destruction of these tribes.  He acknowledged that this would involve separating the children from their parents and severing their tribal connections.”3\\n\",\n\"As we have seen in Australia in recent times, this process of removal can have devastating long-term effects on all parties involved including their descendants.  There is often continuing trauma which is reflected in significantly poorer mental health.\\n\",\n\"Infanticide\\n\",\n\"It is clear that prior to colonisation, Aboriginal families sometimes resorted to infanticide.  This was often a response to prevailing conditions e.g. times of drought, when the group could not adequately provide for another child.  After colonisation, the incidence may have increased.4  Children from mixed relationships (virtually all involving European men and Aboriginal women) were resented by some of the men.  Also, some Elders “in their despair over the loss of their land and culture, had taken the decision to allow their tribes to die out and not raise another generation of children.”5\\n\",\n\"While in today’s society, such actions would be deemed abhorrent, this needs to be viewed in its historical context.  The women of the time had no access to contraception or termination.  The well-being of the entire group was the major consideration, rather than the needs of an individual.\\n\",\n\"References:  1.

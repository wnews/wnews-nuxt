They also eat nectar, flowers and fruit. In the veggie garden and orchard they especially love nibbling on apples, pears, grapes, bananas, corn, lettuce, cucumbers, broccoli and tomatoes. • While possums are mainly herbivores, they have also been known to eat insects and birds’ eggs. • Possums can make all sorts of noises, from grunts and growls to clicks, hisses and screeches. • Most possums are solitary animals, except when raising their young, but ringtail possums tend to live in family groups of three or more. • With both ringtail and brushtail possums the newly born will crawl to the mother’s pouch where it will receive milk from a teat for around 4-5 months.  The young leave the pouch and suckle for another 4-8 weeks riding on their parent’s back until fully weaned. • Possums are protected wildlife in Australia. Without certain permits, it is against the law to trap, hunt or kill possums. • The first possums were brought to New Zealand in 1837 from Australia.

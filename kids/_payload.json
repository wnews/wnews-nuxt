The most common species are the common brushtail possum and the common ringtail possum. • The largest species of possum is the cuscus. • Possums are also native to Papua New Guinea and Sulawesi, and are also found as an introduced species in New Zealand and China. • While some species of possum are common, several are endangered, such as the black-spotted cuscus, which is critically endangered. • A female possum is called a ‘Jill’, a male possum is called a ‘Jack’, and a young possum is called a ‘Joey’. • A group of possums is called a passel. • Possums can live for up to 11 years. • Possums are nocturnal marsupials. • Most possums live in the hollows of tall trees, but the common ringtail possum builds nests known as ‘dreys’ in bushes or trees. • Possums mainly eat eucalyptus and other leaves. They also eat nectar, flowers and fruit. In the veggie garden and orchard they especially love nibbling on apples, pears, grapes, bananas, corn, lettuce, cucumbers, broccoli and tomatoes. • While possums are mainly herbivores, they have also been known to eat insects and birds’ eggs. • Possums can make all sorts of noises, from grunts and growls to clicks, hisses and screeches. • Most possums are solitary animals, except when raising their young, but ringtail possums tend to live in family groups of three or more. • With both ringtail and brushtail possums the newly born will crawl to the mother’s pouch where it will receive milk from a teat for around 4-5 months.  The young leave the pouch and suckle for another 4-8 weeks riding on their parent’s back until fully weaned. • Possums are protected wildlife in Australia. Without certain permits, it is against the law to trap, hunt or kill possums. • The first possums were brought to New Zealand in 1837 from Australia.
